# Console-Commands
## Objective

- Practice the Console Tools
  
## Programming

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment for the LabLinks to an external site..
2. Navigate to your code directory (e.g.: cd my-cs1405-code-dir).
3. Run git clone {yourUrl} to make a local copy of your repository. (Reminder, replace {yourUrl} including the brackets with your actual repo url.)
4. Run code {nameOfYourRepo} to open that directory in VS Code.
5. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`, or the Terminal menu -> New Terminal).
6. Run dotnet new console to create a new project in the current folder.
7. Add and commit the initial project to your repository (git add . and git commit -m 'initial commit').
8. In VS Code, open the generated 'Program.cs' file.
9. Watch the discussion video to understand the following console commands
  - Console.ForegroundColor
  - Console.BackgroundColor
  - Console.SetCursorPosition()
  - Console.Clear()
10. Think through the problem. Find short cuts. If you color each square one at a time you'll end up with over 1000 lines of code. 
11. Recreate this picture of 'Mario' on your console (as best you can)

- To create each 'square' follow these steps:
  - Set the background color
  - Move the cursor to the desired position
  - Console.Write(" "); to print a single square of that color. 

- Again, think through the problem, do not color Mario one square at a time, be smart about your approach
- When you are done be sure to set your back ground color back to black so colors don't 'bleed' into the console.
- Consider this as well.  If you only print one space for each square, you'll have a very skinny Mario. It takes at least 2 spaces to make him look correct, 3 spaces makes him look pretty close to the original, so to make a segment that is 4 squares long, you should print 12 spaces. 

 

Labs must be reviewed in person (or Teams) with me.
